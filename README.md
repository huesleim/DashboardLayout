## Dashboard Layout

This project is a static dashboard interface built with HTML and CSS. It focuses on recreating a complex application-style layout using modern CSS techniques rather than functionality or interactivity.

## Overview

The dashboard is composed of three main sections: a vertical sidebar, a top navigation bar, and a main content area. The structure mirrors common admin or productivity dashboards, emphasizing layout accuracy, spacing, and visual hierarchy.

## What This Project Demonstrates

* Use of **CSS Grid** as the primary layout system for large-scale page structure
* Combining Grid and Flexbox for nested alignment and spacing
* Structuring semantic HTML for complex UIs
* Styling reusable UI patterns such as cards, buttons, and navigation items
* Managing icons and avatars using inline SVGs and data URLs

## Layout Structure

* **Sidebar**: Persistent vertical navigation with icons and grouped actions
* **Navbar**: Search, user info, and quick actions laid out in a grid
* **Main Content**: Project cards, announcements, and trending sections arranged in responsive grids

## Scope

This project is intentionally static. It does not include JavaScript logic or dynamic data handling. The goal is to practice layout composition, consistency, and visual organization in CSS.

## Context

This dashboard was built as a layout exercise, similar to assignments that focus on translating a design into clean, structured HTML and CSS without relying on frameworks.
